# Rapid Connect 4

## Directions

Connect Four is the classic board game most people in the United States has had a pleasure to play sometime in their life. I bring you the same classic game with a twist. Rapid Connect 4!!! Its the same Connect Four rules but now you have 30 seconds to make your move. If the timer runs out before you make a move, you lose your turn and it becomes the next player's turn. To start the game a player is going to hit the "Start" button the game begins and Player #1 has 30 seconds to make a move. After the move is made it becomes Player #2's turn and they have 30 seconds to make a move. Game continue until someone has 4 pieces in a direction.
